# ShufflingNeuralNetworks

This repository presents an implementation of a Shuffling Neural Network, which is deeply explained in the follwing [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07324.pdf).

Here i present an alternative implementation with a relative dataset to train and test the architecture.

To run the project just open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and follow the instructions illustrated inside.
